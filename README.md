![Build Status)](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/athal7/homebridge-hyundai-bluelink/build/main)

This is a [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) platform plugin that uses [bluelinky](https://github.com/Hacksore/bluelinky) to connect your Hyundai or Kia vehicle to HomeKit, which allows you control your vehicle using Siri, shortcuts, or the Home app.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed from the Homebridge web console:
1. Log in to the console and go to the `Plugins` tab
2. Search for `Bluelink`, and install `Homebridge Hyundai BlueLink`
3. Edit the settings in the UI, or directly in the `config.json` file following the schema below

## Configuration

### Sample

```json
"platforms": [
    {
        "credentials": {
            "username": "your username / email",
            "password": "your password",
            "region": "US / CA / EU",
            "brand": "Hyundai / Kia",
            "pin": "your pin"
        },
        "vehicles": [
            {
                "vin": "your VIN",
                "maxRange": 500
            }
        ],
        "remoteStart": {
            "airCtrl": false,
            "heating1": false,
            "defrost": false,
            "airTempvalue": 72,
            "igniOnDuration": 10
        },
        "platform": "Hyundai"
    }
],
```

### Notes
* `vehicles.maxRange` is optional
* `remoteStart.airCtrl` controls whether the HVAC is turned on
* `remoteStart.airTempvalue` is the temperature in Fahrenheit
* `remoteStart.igniOnDuration` must be between 1 and 10, otherwise remote start will fail

## Known Issues

### SSL Key too Small

Log:

```
[Hyundai] Client Error GotError [RequestError]: write EPROTO 1995553232:error:141A318A:SSL routines:tls_process_ske_dhe:dh key too small:../deps/openssl/openssl/ssl/statem/statem_clnt.c:2158:
```

This happens because the Bluelink API used has insecure SSL settings.

Workaround: Edit `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`, change the line `CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2` to `CipherString = DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1` (change 2 to 1 at end of line)

### Status Refresh Delay

Due to Hyundai's [API Rate Limits](https://github.com/Hacksore/bluelinky/wiki/API-Rate-Limits), the car status (locked, on/off, range) is only updated once per hour. Actions taken from homebridge get automatically refreshed, but actions taken elsewhere (e.g. bluelink app, key fab) may not display in homebridge for up to an hour.
